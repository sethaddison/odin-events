# Odin Private Events

The assignment:

You want to build a site similar to a private Eventbrite which allows users to create events and then manage user signups. Users can create events and send invitations and parties. Events take place at a specific date and at a location.

A user can create events. A user can attend many events. An event can be attended by many users. This will require you to model many-to-many relationships and also to be very conscious about your foreign keys and class names.
